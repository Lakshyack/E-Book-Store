# E-Book-Store
I have created an Online Bookstore and E-Library using Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, basic JavaScript, and MySQL. It features an admin email system for book updates and pricing control. Users can order physical books or access e-books online upon payment. The platform categorizes books into Old, Recent, and New, enhancing user browsing.
